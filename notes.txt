Goals:
    - how to raise the average trust level 
	- some way for users to test different parameters (sliders) 

Associate everyone with score of how attractive they are 

Two types of players 
- catfish 
- normal person 

Take into account how many dates they go on to find a match and then they go out of the pool 
	- probability of going on date and getting out 

Catfish person 
- overall game is to go on date with pretty person 

Normal person 
-leave the pool 

If catfish person goes on date with normal person, then they’ll get flagged/reported 
	- Based on how many times they’ve been flagged, decrease the probability of them going on a date 

- also track trust level 

Make policies on platform to see which policies increase the average trust level 
	- make things that determine if people go on a date or not (heuristic) 
	- set the policies in the beginning as params in addition to the rest of the stuff above 

- run for a certain number of dates 

Main goal: 
	- see what kind of policies the user can put to increase the average trust level
