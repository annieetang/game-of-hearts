## Promoting Trust in Online Dating through an Evolutionary Game Model

Reinforcing trust in online dating through an evolutionary game theory standpoint.

A set of scripts for simulating single population and multi population games to see how the strategies evolve over time. We also simulate the games with different parameters to see how the strategies evolve over time, and how to best optimize the parameters to get the most trustworthy agents in the social network.

This project was created in addition to a research paper, presentation, and poster session for the course "Evolutionary Game Theory" at Dartmouth College.
